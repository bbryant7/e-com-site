# Furniture E-commerce Store
<hr>

Project uses React to create a simple SPA for an online furniture store. For this project I practiced working off a wireframe and the site's home page design is based on the design of this site: http://coolmaterial.com/home/best-online-furniture-stores/

## Future Goals:
[] Responsive Design for Mobile
[] Cart page where customers can save a shopping list
